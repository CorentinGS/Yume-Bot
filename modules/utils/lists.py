    "**I'd just like to interject for a moment.**\n\n"
    "What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. "
    "Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, "
    "shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.\n\nMany computer users run a modified version of the "
    "GNU system every day, without realizing it.  Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called 'Linux', "
    "and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.\n\n"
    "There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use."
    " Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run."
    " The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system."
    " Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux."
    " All the so-called 'Linux' distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.",

    "You should try to run the following command : ```sudo rm rf /```\n\n *Use it at your own risk*",

    "New to GNU/Linux ? Then you should try Gentoo...",

    "First off, systemd is not an init system, it has an init system as part of the systemd suite. "
    "systemd is a project to build a standardised lowlevel userland for Linux. "
    "The project is pretty comprehensive and it delivers a lot of functionality under one umbrella. It does away with a lot of older, "
    "often undermaintained software packages, which were traditionally used to assemble a low level userland.\n\n"
    "Which is where the contention comes from, as a system suite systemd is restrictive for Unix virtuosi who are used to tailor a system with wit, "
    "ingenuity, a lick and a prayer and a couple dozen of unrelated packages. systemd makes such knowledge useless.\n\n"
    "The faction that thinks that systemd is Linux's Hiroshima, finds all the added functionality bloat, unnecessary and dangerous, "
    "as it is all under development in one project.All the systemd jokes stem from the comprehensiveness as a low level system suite. "
    "People against it love to joke that one day systemd will write its own kernel."
    "There is a lot of FUD and hate going around. Some arguments do have merit, a lot of eggs in one basket is certainly true, but as with all things in life, "
    "it depends which tradeoff you prefer. Do you want a suite of well designed software, working closely together, "
    "so that system management is streamlined or do you want the complete freedom to tailor your own low level system with a lot of time tested, "
    "interchangeable components. I have no desire to be a low level system designer, so I prefer systemd. I don't hate traditional init systems though."
    "If a Linux system has one and I need to work with it, I'm still happy it boots and starts the necessary services.",

    "When the purpose of some program is to block advertisements, “ad-blocker” is a good term for it. "
    "However, the GNU browser IceCat blocks advertisements that track the user as consequence of broader measures to prevent surveillance by web sites. "
    "This is not an “ad-blocker,” this is surveillance protection.",

    "The term “FLOSS,” meaning “Free/Libre and Open Source Software,” was coined as a way to be neutral between free software and open source. "
    "If neutrality is your goal, “FLOSS” is the best way to be neutral."
    "But if you want to show you stand for freedom, don't use a neutral term.",

    "The term “FOSS,” meaning “Free and Open Source Software,” was coined as a way to be neutral between free software and open source, "
    "but it doesn't really do that. If neutrality is your goal, “FLOSS” is better. But if you want to show you stand for freedom, don't use a neutral term.\n\n"
    "Instead of FOSS, we say, free software or free (libre) software.",

    "Please avoid using the term “google” as a verb, meaning to search for something on the internet. "
    "“Google” is just the name of one particular search engine among others. We suggest to use the term “search the web” or (in some contexts) just “search”. "
    "Try to use a search engine that respects your privacy; for instance, DuckDuckGo claims not to track its users. "
    "(There is no way for outsiders to verify claims of that kind.)",

    "A hacker is someone who enjoys playful cleverness—not necessarily with computers. The programmers in the old MIT free software community of the 60s and 70s referred to themselves as hackers. "
    "Around 1980, journalists who discovered the hacker community mistakenly took the term to mean “security breaker.\n\n"
    "Please don't spread this mistake. People who break security are “crackers.”",

    "Please avoid using the term “PowerPoint” to mean any kind of slide presentation. "
    "“PowerPoint” is just the name of one particular proprietary program to make presentations. "
    "For your freedom's sake, you should use only free software to make your presentations—which means, not PowerPoint. "
    "Recommended options include TeX's beamer class and LibreOffice.org's Impress.",

    "Arch User: What's up, gentoo user? I just finished installing Arch Linux, it took about 20 minutes.\n\n"
